# Active Context - HomeSchool Tracker Development

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Primary Focus: Task 8 - Subscription Flow Testing

### Status: PAUSED for Browser Optimization
**Issue**: Playwright browser automation experiencing cache/rendering conflicts  
**Action**: Created best practices rules, documented challenges, preparing for retry

### Progress Summary
âœ… **Environment Setup Complete**:
- Development server: localhost:5173 âœ“
- Test users created: 3 accounts with authentication âœ“
- PayPal sandbox: 5 subscription plans configured âœ“
- Playwright MCP tools: Integrated and tested âœ“
- Supabase MCP tools: Database operations verified âœ“

ðŸ”§ **Technical Challenge Identified**:
- Browser snapshots returning empty content despite successful navigation
- React/Vite timing issues in automation context
- Need proper browser state management between test runs

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Resume Testing** (after browser optimization):
   - Clear browser cache and restart automation
   - Implement extended wait strategies for React components
   - Test subscription flow with all 5 PayPal plans

2. **Apply New Best Practices**:
   - Use [playwright-testing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/playwright-testing.mdc) rules
   - Implement browser restart procedures
   - Add proper error handling and retries

### Test Environment Ready
```
Users: admin@example.com, testuser@example.com, test.automation@example.com
Passwords: secureAdminPassword123, secureUserPassword123, AutoTest123!
PayPal Plans: Basic Monthly ($9.99), Premium Monthly ($19.99), Basic Annual ($99.99), Premium Annual ($199.99), Owner Admin ($0.01)
Development URL: http://localhost:5173/subscribe
```

## ðŸ”„ Parallel Tasks in Progress

### Task 11: PayPal Webhooks Configuration
**Status**: Partially Complete
- Webhook endpoint: Created and tested âœ“
- PayPal Dashboard: Webhook configured âœ“  
- **Pending**: Environment variable update in Supabase Edge Functions
- **Next**: Test webhook events with subscription flow

### Documentation & Infrastructure
- Comprehensive testing guides created âœ“
- SQL scripts for user seeding âœ“
- Playwright best practices rules âœ“
- Memory bank updated with progress âœ“

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Current Sprint

### Primary Goal: Complete Task 8
- [ ] Successfully test subscription creation for all 5 plans
- [ ] Verify PayPal sandbox integration end-to-end
- [ ] Confirm database subscription records creation
- [ ] Document any edge cases or issues discovered

### Secondary Goals
- [ ] Complete webhook environment configuration (Task 11)
- [ ] Begin Task 9: Database subscription storage implementation
- [ ] Optimize testing infrastructure for future use

## ðŸ”§ Technical Context

### Architecture Status
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite âœ“
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + Database + Edge Functions) âœ“  
- **Payment**: PayPal SDK + Subscription API âœ“
- **Testing**: Playwright MCP + Supabase MCP âœ“

### Current Environment
- **Development**: Fully configured and running
- **Testing**: Automated tools ready, browser optimization needed
- **PayPal Sandbox**: 5 plans configured and verified
- **Database**: Test users and schema ready

### Known Challenges
1. **Browser Automation**: Cache/rendering timing issues
2. **React Hydration**: Need proper wait strategies
3. **Vite HMR**: Conflicts with automation timing
4. **Test Isolation**: Need proper cleanup between runs

## ðŸŽ‰ Recent Wins
- Successfully integrated multiple MCP tools (Playwright + Supabase)
- Created comprehensive test user management system
- Established direct database manipulation capabilities  
- Built robust testing documentation and procedures
- Identified and documented browser automation challenges
