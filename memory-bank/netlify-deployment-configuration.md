# Netlify Deployment Configuration

## Overview
This document records the Netlify deployment configuration completed for HomeSchoolTracker, including environment variable fixes, security enhancements, and troubleshooting PowerShell issues.

## Site Information
- **Site ID**: `ef25c9b7-068c-4aa0-a384-86fce327ddba`
- **Site Name**: `homeschooltracker`
- **Production URL**: `https://homeschooltracker.netlify.app`
- **Team**: Little Town Labs

## Issues Resolved

### 1. PayPal URL Configuration (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: PayPal URLs were pointing to localhost instead of production domain
**Solution**: Updated environment variables via Netlify CLI
- `FRONTEND_PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL`: `http://localhost:5173/subscribe/cancel` → `https://homeschooltracker.netlify.app/subscribe/cancel`
- `FRONTEND_PAYPAL_RETURN_URL`: `http://localhost:5173/subscribe/success` → `https://homeschooltracker.netlify.app/subscribe/success`

### 2. Security - Secrets Configuration
**Problem**: Sensitive API keys were not marked as secrets
**Solution**: Used Netlify web interface to mark as secrets:
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` → marked as secret ✅
- `VITE_PAYPAL_SECRET` → marked as secret ✅
- `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` → marked as secret ✅

### 3. PowerShell Terminal Issues
**Problem**: PSReadLine 2.0.0 causing console buffer exceptions
**Symptoms**: 
```
System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: The value must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the console's buffer size
```
**Solutions Identified**:
- Update PSReadLine: `Install-Module PSReadLine -Force -SkipPublisherCheck`
- Disable PSReadLine: `Remove-Module PSReadLine -Force`
- Use cmd instead: `cmd /c "netlify command"`
- Use Git Bash as alternative
- Use Netlify web interface (most reliable)

## Configuration Files Enhanced

### netlify.toml Enhancements
Added comprehensive configuration including:
- Security headers (CSP, XSS protection, frame options)
- Caching rules for static assets
- Deploy context configurations
- PayPal and Supabase domain allowlists in CSP

### Scripts Created
1. **`scripts/setup-netlify-env.js`**: Node.js script using Netlify API
2. **`scripts/netlify-env-setup.bat`**: Windows batch alternative to avoid PowerShell issues

## Environment Variables Status
All required environment variables are properly configured:

| Variable | Status | Secret | Context |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| VITE_SUPABASE_URL | ✅ | No | All |
| VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY | ✅ | No | All |
| VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID | ✅ | No | All |
| PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID | ✅ | No | All |
| PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET | ✅ | **Yes** | All contexts |
| VITE_PAYPAL_SECRET | ✅ | **Yes** | All contexts |
| VITE_RESEND_API_KEY | ✅ | **Yes** | All contexts |
| PAYPAL_API_URL | ✅ | No | All |
| PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID | ✅ | No | All |
| VITE_OWNER_EMAIL | ✅ | No | All |
| FRONTEND_PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL | ✅ | No | All |
| FRONTEND_PAYPAL_RETURN_URL | ✅ | No | All |

## Deployment Status
- **Current Deploy**: `684a156d742810267cb07f6c`
- **Status**: Ready ✅
- **Framework**: Vite (auto-detected)
- **Build Time**: 78 seconds
- **SSL**: Active ✅

## Tools and Methods Used
1. **Netlify MCP Tools**: For querying deployment status and environment variables
2. **Netlify CLI**: For environment variable updates (with PowerShell workarounds)
3. **Netlify Web Interface**: For marking secrets (most reliable method)
4. **Enhanced netlify.toml**: For build and security configuration

## Lessons Learned
1. **PowerShell Issues**: PSReadLine 2.0.0 has known console buffer issues - use alternatives
2. **Environment Variables**: Netlify web interface is most reliable for secret marking
3. **PayPal Integration**: Production URLs are critical for subscription flows
4. **Security Headers**: CSP policies need careful domain allowlisting for third-party integrations
5. **MCP Tools**: Excellent for querying status, but CLI/web interface better for modifications

## Next Steps
- Monitor PayPal subscription flow in production
- Consider updating PSReadLine on development machine
- Test all subscription scenarios with production URLs
- Monitor security headers effectiveness
