# PayPal Subscription Integration Completion - PRD

## Project Overview

Complete the PayPal subscription service integration for HomeSchoolTracker using the new PayPal MCP tools to replace manual configuration and enhance the existing implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### Implemented Components
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions: `create-paypal-subscription`, `get-paypal-subscription-details`, `cancel-paypal-subscription`, `webhook-handler`
- ✅ Frontend Components: `SubscribeButton`, subscription management panels
- ✅ Database Schema: `subscription_plans` and `user_subscriptions` tables
- ✅ Basic PayPal integration architecture

### Critical Issues to Resolve
- ❌ Using placeholder PayPal Plan IDs instead of real ones
- ❌ Missing PayPal environment variable configuration
- ❌ Products and plans not created in PayPal system
- ❌ Subscription flow untested and non-functional
- ❌ Frontend shows "Configuration Error" due to missing `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: PayPal Product & Plan Setup
- Create HomeSchoolTracker product in PayPal using MCP tools
- Create subscription plans with proper pricing structure:
  - Basic Plan: $9.99/month with 30-day trial
  - Premium Plan: $19.99/month with 30-day trial
  - Annual Basic: $99.99/year (2 months free)
  - Annual Premium: $199.99/year (2 months free)
- Obtain real PayPal Plan IDs to replace database placeholders

#### FR2: Environment Configuration
- Configure all required PayPal environment variables in Supabase Edge Functions
- Set up frontend PayPal Client ID configuration
- Ensure webhook verification is properly configured
- Update database with real PayPal Plan IDs

#### FR3: Integration Enhancement
- Leverage PayPal MCP tools to simplify/enhance existing Edge Functions
- Implement proper error handling for PayPal API failures
- Add comprehensive logging for subscription lifecycle events
- Ensure proper trial period handling

#### FR4: Subscription Management
- Enable users to create subscriptions through existing SubscribeButton
- Implement subscription status synchronization between PayPal and local database
- Support subscription cancellation through existing UI
- Handle subscription renewal and billing cycle updates

#### FR5: Testing & Verification
- Create test subscriptions using PayPal sandbox
- Verify webhook event processing
- Test complete subscription lifecycle (create, activate, cancel)
- Validate subscription status synchronization

### Technical Requirements

#### TR1: PayPal MCP Tool Integration
- Use `mcp_paypal_create_product` for product creation
- Use `mcp_paypal_create_subscription_plan` for plan setup
- Use `mcp_paypal_list_subscription_plans` to obtain Plan IDs
- Integrate `mcp_paypal_create_subscription` capabilities where beneficial

#### TR2: Database Updates
- Update `subscription_plans` table with real PayPal Plan IDs
- Ensure proper foreign key relationships
- Add any missing fields for MCP tool compatibility

#### TR3: Environment Variables Setup
Required variables for Supabase Edge Functions:
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` 
- `PAYPAL_API_URL`
- `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`
- `FRONTEND_PAYPAL_RETURN_URL`
- `FRONTEND_PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL`

Required variables for Frontend:
- `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`

#### TR4: Code Integration Points
- Update existing Edge Functions to leverage MCP capabilities where appropriate
- Enhance SubscribeButton component configuration handling
- Improve admin subscription management using MCP tools
- Add proper error boundaries and user feedback

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
1. Users can successfully create subscriptions through the application
2. All subscription plans are properly configured with real PayPal Plan IDs
3. Subscription status synchronizes correctly between PayPal and application
4. Users can cancel subscriptions through the application interface
5. Admin panel displays accurate subscription information

### Secondary Success Criteria
1. Webhook events are processed correctly for all subscription lifecycle events
2. Trial periods function as specified (30 days)
3. Payment failures are handled gracefully
4. Subscription management is accessible from existing UI components
5. All PayPal API interactions use proper error handling and logging

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: PayPal Resource Creation
- Create HomeSchoolTracker product in PayPal
- Set up all subscription plans with proper pricing
- Collect real PayPal Plan IDs
- Update database configuration

### Phase 2: Environment & Configuration
- Configure all PayPal environment variables
- Update database with real Plan IDs
- Test environment variable access from Edge Functions
- Verify frontend PayPal Client ID configuration

### Phase 3: Integration Enhancement
- Review and enhance existing Edge Functions with MCP capabilities
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Update admin tools for subscription management

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Create test subscriptions in sandbox environment
- Verify complete subscription lifecycle
- Test webhook event processing
- Validate admin management capabilities

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
- Switch to production PayPal credentials
- Deploy updated Edge Functions
- Update production environment variables
- Monitor initial production subscriptions

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing Supabase database schema
- Must preserve existing frontend component interfaces
- Must support both sandbox and production PayPal environments
- Must handle trial period logic as specified in original design
- Must maintain existing admin panel functionality

## Dependencies

- PayPal Developer Account access
- Supabase project administrative access
- PayPal MCP tools properly configured and accessible
- Existing HomeSchoolTracker application infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Product Setup Complete**: HomeSchoolTracker product exists in PayPal with all required subscription plans
2. **Configuration Active**: All environment variables set and functional
3. **Database Updated**: All placeholder Plan IDs replaced with real PayPal Plan IDs
4. **Subscription Flow Works**: Users can complete subscription creation from UI to PayPal approval
5. **Status Synchronization**: Subscription status updates properly reflect between PayPal and application
6. **Cancellation Functional**: Users can cancel subscriptions through application interface
7. **Admin Tools Active**: Admin panel can view and manage user subscriptions
8. **Testing Complete**: All subscription lifecycle scenarios tested and validated
9. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks for all PayPal API failures
10. **Production Ready**: Configuration supports both sandbox and production environments

## Risk Mitigation

- **PayPal API Changes**: Use MCP tools which abstract API complexity
- **Environment Configuration**: Implement validation checks for required variables
- **Data Synchronization**: Add retry logic and manual reconciliation tools
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test scenarios in sandbox before production
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain ability to revert to current non-functional state if needed
